# scipion-em-plugins
Repo to group many Scipion plugins for development

The main goal of this repo is to facilitate the development workflow of the different plugin repos.
Instead of having a single project for each one, here all of them are contained as submodules. 

A nice tutorial for submodules can be found here:
